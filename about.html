            <h1>How I do it</h1>
            <p id=skills-intro>
                There's a lot involved in making a great product.<br /><br />This is what goes into one.
            </p>
            <div id=skills-container>
                <div class='skill-container skill-container-left'>
                    <img src='./assets/graphics/design.svg' />
                    <div class=skills-inner>
                        <h3>User-focused design</h3>
                        <p>
                            I belive that design can genuinely make or break a product, but it's often further down
                            the product backlog than it should be. <br /><br /> I treat design like a commodity; it's every user's first impression, and unlike that
                            clich&eacute;  we love to throw around, we actually <i>do</i> judge books by their covers. <br /><br />Design isn't just aesthetics though,
                            it's as much about how the product is laid out and intended to be used. I design easy-to-to-use products
                            that have a clean, smooth look.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class='skill-container skill-container-left'>
                    <img src='./assets/graphics/front-end.svg' />
                    <div class=skills-inner>
                        <h3>Responsive websites</h3>
                        <p>
                            The only thing worse than egg salad that's been left in the sun for slightly too long is a
                            website that loads slower than Southern molasses, and clearly hasn't been optimised for mobile. <br /><br />Mobile devices are now royalty where browsing is concerned; heavy
                            pages and haphazard layouts really don't cater to a website's first class users. <br /><br />Bootstrap or
                            otherwise, my products are built mobile-first (where applicable), and are intended to be as light as is reasonable.
                        </p>

                <div class='skill-container skill-container-left'>
                    <img src='./assets/graphics/secure.svg' />
                    <div class=skills-inner>
                        <h3>Fast, secure backends</h3>
                        <p>
                            I want my backend code to be three things: fast, safe, and well designed. That last one
                            affects developers more than anyone else, but from the end user's perspective the first two
                            attributes take precedence.<br /><br /> Any product I build that has any form of backend interaction
                            has to be served over HTTPS and have proper security measures built into it; from properly hashed passwords
                            to cross-site-scripting protection. <br /><br /> Server side code (API or otherwise) should execute quickly and
                            be designed to scale. Nobody really cares if you're in peak hours, they just want their delivery confirmation.
                        </p>

                    <div class=skills-inner>
                        <h3>DevOps know-how</h3>
                        <p>
                             Building a great product isn't enough, you also have to ship and <i>maintain</i> those
                             products. I take the DevOps approach to solving both these problems. <br /><br />I think unit tests
                             save lives (if not lives then sanity, user impressions, and work relationships), scripting
                             is one of a software engineer's most valuable tools, Continuous Delivery is
                             a necessity, and servers shouldn't be touched manually. <br /><br />Taking a little bit of time to
                             properly implement the above means I don't produce codebases held togther by hopes and prayers,
                             and also means I can deploy to production regularly, with confidence.

                            There will something about Mathematics here, just as soon as I figure out an appropriate graphic to represent it.
