          I started this little book review to keep me accountable while reading this year. I have a thing for actual paper books (hence the dead trees).</p>

        <p class="book-review">
          I bought this book after taking on a role as a software team lead within my current 
          company. My hope was that it would help me clarify what my role, now involving some 
          management duties, should look like, and how I could perform it better.
          <br><br>
          My primary takeaway wasn’t so much related to concrete management practices, but rather a better grasp of the 
          idea that management is a separate career track all on its own (and that I’m not, at this 
          moment in time, ready to completely abandon software development as part of my job 
          description). I’ve heard that little nugget about management a few times elsewhere, 
          but it sunk in a little deeper after the first few chapters.
          <br><br>
          Zhou writes with a conversational style; she’s honest, real, and displays an admirable 
          (and rare) balance of confidence and humility. She clearly has a lot of experience in 
          management, honing her craft at one of the planet’s biggest companies (Facebook) during 
          some of its high growth years.
          <br><br>
          That experience is distilled into extremely practical 
          advice that reaches far beyond the design industry she specialises in, highlighting 
          the universality of the skills and practices required to successfully lead people in any 
          situation and industry. The book is particularly targeted at newer managers, and looks to 
          be a useful tool to help navigate the first few years of refining one’s leadership skills 
          in a business environment.
          <br><br>
          While not everything within the pages is directly applicable to me right now, I still took 
          a lot away. Highlights include the importance of honest, thoughtful feedback (for both myself 
          and for others), tips on how to propagate healthy culture, lessons on managing 
          <em>myself</em>, and most importantly, what management actually entails.
          <br><br>
          This is a book I 
          know I’m going to reach for again and again; I can see it being one of those gems that 
          reveals new insights as I re-read it with ever-increasing experience.
