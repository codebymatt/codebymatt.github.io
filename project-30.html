    <div class="explanation">
      <p>
        I want my job to be more than a means to support my family; I want to make a difference in
        our world with my daily work. I'm very conscious that to make a
        <em>meaningful</em> difference in any given industry, it requires a degree of
        specialization. You can't drive innovation when you don't deeply understand the field you're
        working in.
      </p>
      <!-- <p>
        I've long struggled with the idea of specialising; I often feel like if I pick one
        particular road that I'll miss out on all the other awesome work being done out there. I'm
        very aware, however, that not choosing is a decision in and of itself. When I think about
        it, my problem isn't that I'm afraid of committing to specialisation, it's that
        <em>I don't know what field I want to commit to.</em>
      </p> -->
      <p>
        In 2024 I turn 30. I'm giving myself until then to learn, research, and study the different
        areas that have the potential to drive
        <span class="underlined">positive and impactful change</span> in our societies while also
        piquing my interest. I've identified 5 areas, listed below, that I want to focus my efforts
        and attention on, with the end goal of choosing an industry to devote a significant chunk of
        my professional career to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe it'll take less than two years, maybe it'll take more. That doesn't matter. What
        matters is that despite the progress we've made as humanity, there is more to do. We need
        more justice, more equality, and less suffering, for both our planet and our people. I want
        my life to make other's lives better, and this is a baby step towards fulfilling that goal.
        More to follow!
