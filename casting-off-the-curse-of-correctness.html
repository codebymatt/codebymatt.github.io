      <h2 id="i-dont-want-to-write-if-im-not-right">I don‚Äôt want to write if I‚Äôm not right</h2>
      <p>
        For a long time I‚Äôve wanted to write. I love reading, I‚Äôve enjoyed it for as long as I can
        remember, and my affinity for consuming written words has long desired to spill over into
        writing words of my own. I‚Äôve been held back by the usual suspects that haunt anyone
        desiring to produce anything remotely personal, those voices that scream everything must be
        perfect, and what will people think, and
        oh-my-goodness-you‚Äôve-never-done-this-before-and-cannot-possibly-be-good-at-it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the last few years I‚Äôve gotten better at turning down the volume of some of those voices.
        I‚Äôve learned to care less of what people think. I‚Äôve (mostly) abandoned the pursuit of
        perfection in favour of a pursuit of excellence. I‚Äôve realised everyone sucks at things the
        first time they try them, except those kids that win all the sprints in primary school
        because they were born with a disproportionate amount of fast twitch fibres. I‚Äôm talking to
        you, Dave.
      </p>
      <p>
        But even though those internal voices now whisper more than they scream, I still find myself
        hesitating to volunteer my thoughts in a forum where people might actually read them.
        Recently it‚Äôs become a little clearer why this is: I‚Äôm afraid of others thinking my opinion
        is wrong. To put it more dramatically, I have a curse of correctness.
      </p>
      <h2 id="whats-wrong-with-being-wrong?">What‚Äôs wrong with being wrong?</h2>
      <p>
        I hate being seen as unconsidered, or as anything less than thorough. Partly because I spent
        years of my life studying math, a discipline founded on an unyielding search for irrefutable
        truth, but mostly because I‚Äôm a human with an ego almost as large as my considerable
        appetite. One great way to feel dumb is to express your thoughts, have someone critique
        them, and then take that extremely personally and assume that everyone in the world thinks
        you‚Äôre an intellectual clown. I really don‚Äôt like feeling dumb, mainly because of the
        aforementioned ego.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a very flawed way to think, though, because for better or worse life is not an
        elegantly balanced equation you can solve if you just give it a little careful thought. In
        fact, the thought pattern that sharing an incorrect opinion will result in your shame is
        just perfectionism in a clever new disguise. If you wait until you know everything perfectly
        before you venture an opinion you‚Äôll have a lot of grey hair (or none at all!), and not
        enough teeth to enjoy anything harder than oatmeal.
      </p>
      <p>
        (By the way, perfectionism is a master at flying under the radar. Everyone hears the nagging
        voice of perfectionism in some form or other, but most dismiss it because they would like to
        distance themselves from such a dirty word. Why is that? Because a considerable number of
        those claiming perfectionism are very happy to tell you ‚ÄúGosh I‚Äôm such a perfectionist‚Äù in a
        very loud voice while throwing their head back and rolling their eyes in a very exaggerated
        manner, when really they just want you to know they organise their wardrobe by colour, and
        in extreme cases, garment length. This is what the kids are calling a humble brag, and is to
        be avoided.)
      </p>
      <h2 id="being-wrong-is-allowed">Turns out it's allowed</h2>
      <p>
        Turns out when it comes to opinion there‚Äôs no rule that says you must always be right about
        everything. You might think such a rule exists, but chances are you made it up yourself, or
        someone who has no business spreading this particular lie decided to teach it to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Something that‚Äôs helping me win the battle against the curse of correctness is
        distinguishing when it‚Äôs OK to be wrong. I‚Äôm not OK with being wrong about facts. I
        <em>want</em> to be on the right side of truth when it comes to how curved the earth
        actually is. I take great comfort in knowing I‚Äôll never accidentally tumble into the abyss
        of space by venturing too close to the edge. It‚Äôs important to seek the truth, whether
        that‚Äôs scientific (the earth is very spherical), social (immigration has a net positive
        effect on an economy when it doesn‚Äôt overrun shared resources), and everything in between.
      </p>
      <p>
        I‚Äôve realised that it <em>is</em> OK to have a wrong opinion. A wonderful thing about
        opinions is that they can be changed. An unfortunate thing about them is that they won‚Äôt be
        changed until you‚Äôre presented with a good reason to change them. Often that reason comes in
        the form of someone else‚Äôs point of view that‚Äôs a little more grounded in fact or
        experience. In fact, sometimes you won‚Äôt be exposed to a more informed opinion on a
        particular subject unless you‚Äôre willing to venture your own flawed one.
      </p>
      <h2 id="just-be-careful-about-it">Just be careful about it</h2>
      <p>
        We live in a world that‚Äôs full of differences. Culture, language, and societal norms often
        shift across the relatively short span of a few hundred kilometers, never mind across oceans
        and continents. The Information Age has transitioned to the Connected Age, where you can be
        in Ivory Coast or Australia or Ireland or Bolivia, and instantly communicate with someone on
        the literal other side of the world. Hand in hand with this instant connectedness comes the
        loss of shared context. A joke that would summon a cackle from the average Dubliner might
        result in general confusion in the average Californian, and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
        Opinions work the same way. I‚Äôm deeply aware of the need to be conscious of the difference
        that exists in our world, both locally and globally, but the answer isn‚Äôt keeping quiet in
        fear of someone thinking I‚Äôm wrong. Firstly, I often am and there‚Äôs no way around it.
        Secondly, no-one will ever look at life from the exact same perspective as me. When I
        withhold my opinions out of fear of being wrong I lose the opportunity to learn, and others
        lose the opportunity to learn from me. I‚Äôve decided I want to share my opinions more, but
        with some guardrails in place so I avoid being a jerk. Here they are!
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Don‚Äôt advocate for practices or mindsets that are harmful to other people minding their
          own business
        </li>
        <li>Don‚Äôt pretend to be an expert when I‚Äôm not</li>
        <li>Avoid absolutes where possible</li>
        <li>
          Accept I‚Äôll often be wrong, but understand that realising that is the first step to being
          more right
        </li>
        <li>Change my mind when it makes sense to</li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="have-your-opinions-but-hold-them-loosely">
        Have your opinions, but hold them loosely
      </h2>
      <p>
        The popular wisdom of having strong opinions that are loosely held really resonates with me.
        I might hold my opinions now, and I‚Äôll live in accordance with them, but when something or
        someone raises a genuine challenge to one I want to be open to changing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        So here I am with a new opinion on incorrectness. Once you‚Äôre being considerate of others
        and are open to having your mind changed, don‚Äôt be afraid of being wrong.
